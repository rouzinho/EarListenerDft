This is a DFT plugin to integrate ROS inside Cedar.

Everything you want to know about DFT -> https://dynamicfieldtheory.org/

Cedar is the C++ Framework implementing the concepts of DFT -> https://cedar.ini.rub.de/

Everything you need to know about ROS -> http://www.ros.org/

## Getting Started

The plugin is a basic ROS subscriber reading data from a topic with the type Float64.
Of course you can adapat it to subscribe to any topic.

The code work for the 6.x version of Cedar.


### Prerequisites

You first need to install cedar by following the instructions here : https://bitbucket.org/cedar/development

You can't use a precompiled version of Cedar to compile and run the plugin.

I suggest reading about how to create a plugin in Cedar first, it will greatly help to understand how it works : https://cedar.ini.rub.de/tutorials/writing_custom_code_for_cedar/

### Installing

First clone the repository :

`git clone https://github.com/rouzinho/ROS-Subscriber-Cedar.git`

In the project.conf, change the CEDAR_HOME directory to your own :

`set(CEDAR_HOME "your_own_cedar_repository")`

Then create a build repository and prepare the environment for the compilation :

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

Finally start the compilation :

`make`
